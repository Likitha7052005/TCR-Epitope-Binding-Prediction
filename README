🧬 TCR–Epitope Binding Prediction Using Machine Learning (CatBoost + TF-IDF k-mers)
This project aims to predict whether a T-cell receptor (TCR) will bind to a given epitope (antigen peptide) using classical machine learning methods.
Unlike deep learning models that require huge GPUs and millions of samples, this approach uses:

✔ TF-IDF based k-mer feature engineering
✔ CatBoost classifier optimized for sparse biological data
✔ Hard negative sampling to create realistic non-binding pairs

This pipeline achieves 92–95% accuracy and AUC ~0.98, outperforming XGBoost, LightGBM, and BiLSTM for this dataset.

📌 📁 Dataset Information

The dataset used is McPAS-TCR, a publicly available immunology dataset.

Dataset After Preprocessing

Total positive pairs: ~4,261

Columns used:

CDR3β sequence (TCR)

Epitope sequence

All rows represent real binding pairs

Since the dataset contains only binding pairs, we generate hard negatives to train the model.

Final Dataset After Negative Sampling

Total samples: ~10,540

Positives: 4,261

Negatives (generated): ~6,279

Balanced dataset suitable for ML training

📌 🚀 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Load Positive Binding Data

From McPAS-TCR:

Extract TCR (CDR3β) and epitope sequences

Remove duplicates & very short sequences

2️⃣ Hard Negative Sampling

We generate realistic non-binding pairs by:

Picking TCRs from local clusters (same first 3 amino acids)

Pairing them with random wrong epitopes

Ensuring new pairs are not present in positive data

This creates challenging negative examples → improves accuracy.

3️⃣ Feature Engineering Using TF-IDF k-mers

Each TCR and epitope is split into 1-mer, 2-mer, 3-mer fragments.

Example:
TCR "CASSLG" →

1-mers: C A S S L G

2-mers: CA AS SS SL LG

3-mers: CAS ASS SSL SLG

TF-IDF converts them into large sparse vectors that represent motif importance.
